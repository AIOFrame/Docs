    <h1>Efforts</h1>
    <p>Rome wasn't built in one day, as so AIO wasn't built in a day either. Yet AIO helps you build web apps in one day!</p>
    <p>AIO has been under coding since couple years from now, in the beginning it was very complicated to even plan its structure but after lot of struggle of re-coding, bug fixing we are at a stable stage.</p>
    <div class="mb40"></div>
    <p><strong>The Failure - </strong> The first application built under AIO was for a major airlines, the app was to book meeting rooms. It was almost deployed. Second project was for a construction company to manage their projects and employees and third was for a tailor store to create customizable orders and add products by barcode scanning. Unfortunate that these were not a huge success but it was trial run for AIO. AIO had already been stable from first project but the remaining projects helped AIO cover up a lot of features and improvements.</p>
    <div class="mb40"></div>
    <p><strong>The Success - </strong> The fourth application, <a href="https://filetax.me" target="_blank">FileTax</a>. It was successfully deployed at <a href="https://filetax.me" target="_blank">www.filetax.me</a> and being multi-lingual it helped AIO improve its translation system.</p>
    <p>Each project contributed to AIO in its own way, based on the project's needs AIO kept expanding.</p>
